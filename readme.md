# File Check Application Based On MD5 and Keccak
+ ## Description
    Hashing is a wide-used technique in computers and networks today. Our work of this project is to implement MD5 and SHA3-256 hashing functions and build up a file check system for users to utilize them in the real-world scenarios. We implemented these two hash functions in Python and built up a user-friendly User Interface. This system is universal and efficient to use and deploy.
+ ## Get start
    "checker.py" is the main starter of this application. After start by "python checker.py" in your terminal, the main frame of this application will be shown. Then you can use this application to do the following jobs.
    + String Input: by selecting this option you can compute the md5/keccak hash value of a string;
    + File Input: by selecting this option you can compute the md5/keccak hash value of a file;
    + String Compare: by selecting this option you can compute and compare the hash values of two strings(the value would be the same while the files are equal and would be different while the strings are not same in most of the cases);
    + File Compare: by selecting this option you can compute and compare the hash values of two files(the value would be the same while the files are equal and would be different while the files are not same in most of the cases);
+ ## Helping on MD5
    Our application is not only an application which can let you compute the hash values of strings and files but also an application which can let you know completely of the two hash functions, especially md5. Thus, while you do md5 hashing each time, there will be not only outputs in the UI, but also outputs with exhaustive steps of the processes in each round of the computation of md5 hashing. Hope you can get some help while you are facing some difficult bug in your implementation of md5 function.
